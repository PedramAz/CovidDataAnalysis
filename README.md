# CovidDataAnalysis
Created a new SQL Server database 
Two tables added to the database including CovidDeaths and CovidVaccination 
time-series data from SQL, saved in 4 separate excel workbooks to import into Tableau. 
Note: Tableau public doesn't offer direct SQL databse connection so we need to export workbooks first then import into Tableau.
